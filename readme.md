# Metric-ify

Made with ❤️ for 'Digital Alpha's SEC Filing Analyzer for SAAS companies' event, hosted by IIT Kharagpur at the 10th Inter-IIT Tech Meet.

The metric focussed analysis tool will predict a company's revenue growth and success potential, using a variety of metrics from the EDGAR database and other sources(such as the company's stock price etc.)
The analyzer will try to give an accurate analysis based on the form filings of the company(such as the 10-K,10-Q and 8-K forms), and using factors adjusted according to the company's domain of interest and relevance.

We hope that it serves as a useful tool for the needed simplification of financial data.

## Method of Analysis

- The calculation of a SAAS company's future, is based on a varietty of tangible and intangible factors. We have sought out the most accurate and measurable ways to predict the same, using factors that we found were most precise in giving us the required 'Future Success Potential'. Examples of a few such factors are:
   - The cashflow of a company.
   - Their long term debt.
   - Asset contraction/expansion
   - and other such directly measurable values.

We have made it easy to expand upon this list of factors, so that a user can change the metrics important in their consideration or if new metrics are added in the EDGAR database(such as carbon footprint/environmental credits if sustainability is important in the domain) and this will allow the app to be future proof.
